***Exploration and Exploitation: Which Research Strategy Are You Better At?***

This study quantifies and analyzes individual-level abilities of scientists from utilizing either an exploration or an exploitation strategy. 
Specifically, we present a Research Strategy Q model, which untangles the coupling effect of scientists’ research ability (Q_\alpha) and research strategy ability (E_\alpha^\pi) on research performance. 
Q_\alpha indicates scientists’ fundamental ability to publish high-quality papers, while E_\alpha^\pi indicates scientists’ proficiency in terms of exploration and exploitation strategies. 
Five research strategies proposed by our previous study are employed. We generate the synthetic data and collect empirical data as our experimental dataset. 
We show that these research strategies present different benefit and risk characteristics. 
Adopting some exploitation strategies tends to stifle research performance, while exploration strategies are high risk and high yield.
Q_\alpha and E_\alpha^\pi have the predictive power for research performance.
Moreover, we find that, first, scholars who prefer to execute a research strategy may not necessarily be better at executing it. 
Second, one scholar has differences in his/her abilities towards different strategies, while some scholars have differences in their abilities towards the same strategy.
Third, exploration and exploitation are not contradictory but complementary from the perspective of proficiency, while they are mutually exclusive from the perspective of selection preference.
